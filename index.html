<p>A core philosophy of alternative medicine is holistic care,or treatment that addresses an individual as a whole person. 
 Proponents of alternative medicine believe in the bodyâ€™s power to heal itself and believe treatment should involve the body, mind, and spirit. 
 Care is personalized and varies based on symptoms. 
 A patient-practitioner relationship characterized by a partnership in which the patient is encouraged to question 
 and suggest treatment options is central to an alternative care approach.</p>
